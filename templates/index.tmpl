          This site provides the
          most important articles on Paine, the known and some soon-to-be-known
          new works, and the deattributions we have made. We were founded to
          correct the record on Paine, and rescue it from the negative
          propaganda and slander perpetrated against him by most historians in
          the 19th century. For the most part we have succeeded. Now we are on
          the threshold of making public our findings on Paine's complete works,
          after twenty years of research, and the establishment of the first
          official <a

            Board for the Collected Works of Thomas Paine</a>, staffed by the
